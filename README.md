Real-Time Twitter Stream with MeteorJS. This application opens a connection with Twitter via the streaming API and listens for new Tweets by Raleigh and Wake 911. @RW911 is an account that automatically publishes accident reports as they happen, so this is an attempt to mine that data, geocode any given addresses and visualize it in a map in real-time. Potentially, this could also publish to Waze to inform users of the accident and suggest a detour. Other possibilities may include data analysis on which areas of the city accidents happen the most, and what is the frequency of accidents.
